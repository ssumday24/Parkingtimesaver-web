# **Parktimesaver Project Overview**

 Parktimesaver is an innovative solution designed to address the growing challenge of finding available parking spaces in increasingly crowded urban environments. As parking lots multiply rapidly, the struggle to locate an open spot becomes more pronounced. Our mission at Parktimesaver is to streamline this process, making parking more accessible and less time-consuming.

 

 **How It Works**

 By introducing a system where you can reserve a parking space at a specific time and pay online within a few hours of using the parking lot, Parktimesaver aims to drastically reduce the time and stress associated with parking.

 Parktimesaver is committed to improving the urban parking experience and making it more efficient for everyone.

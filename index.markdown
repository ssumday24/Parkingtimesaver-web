# **Mission Statement**

**Core Purpose:** 

These days, as parking places are increasing with rapid rate, we have difficulty in finding parking lots that are available. 
 
To solve this problem, we have thought about a parking lot reservation system that allows you to reserve a space at a specific time, and place. 

**Core Values:**
1. **Accessibility:** We believe in making parking accessible to all, creating inclusive solutions that cater to diverse user needs.

2. **Efficiency:** We are committed to enhancing efficiency in urban transportation, saving time and resources for our users.

3. **Innovation:** We embrace innovation to continuously improve our parking solutions, staying at the forefront of technology and user experience.

4. **Sustainability:** We prioritize sustainable practices, aiming to minimize the environmental impact of parking and contribute to greener cities.

5. **Community:** We value community engagement, fostering a sense of connection and collaboration among users, partners, and stakeholders.

# **what is parkingtimesaver?**

 When using large parking lots such as department stores and marts, many people visit seats for hours at most to park in the parking lot. Also, people are uncomfortable with long queues to pay when they leave the parking lot after solving their work. To solve this problem, we set the goal of developing a site with a parking lot reservation system that allows you to reserve a seat on a fixed time and a payment window that allows payments to be made online within a few hours of using the parking lot.
